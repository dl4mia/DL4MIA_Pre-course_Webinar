# EMBO-DL4MIA Pre-course exercises and materials

## Schedule:

- Webinar 1 (April 15th 14:00-17:00 CEST): Q&A session mainly focusing on notebooks 1 and 2, but happy to answer any questions.
- Webinar 2 (April 29th 14:00-17:00 CEST): Q&A session mainly focusing on notebooks 3 and 4, but happy to answer any questions. 
- Webinar 3 (May 3rd 14:00-17:00 CEST): Optional additional Q&A session if required, can answer anything left unclear from the previous two sessions.

## setup
The notebooks have been setup to run on Google Collab

# Intro to Image Analysis Notebook 1

The exercises in the first notebook will refresh your image analysis knowledge and teach basic image analysis methods in python with scikit-image.
- `1_intro_to_Image_Analysis.ipynb`: image analysis refresher on data from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl for nucleus segmentation. 

If you are unfamiliar with image analysis or python in general, please check out the additional materials below.

 # Image Classification with pytorch Notebooks 2-4:

We provide exercises for pytorch.

Exercises for Image Classification with pytorch. Contains the following exercises:
- `2_Data_Preparation.ipynb`: pytorch dataloader for classification. 
- `3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: image classification with a simple logistic regression model. 
- `4_Multi_Layer_Perceptron.ipynb`: image classification with a multi-layer perceptron. 

All the exercises use the [CIFAR10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).


## Content

These exercises will cover basic machine learning and computer vision concepts relevant for image classification.
You can find lectute notes recapping these contents ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PNoyDIemKKE7Eo02txJfY0kge7tqlrWB1EY9USK4OGY/edit?usp=sharing)), covering:

- Machine Learning Basics
    - Supervised Learning
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Computer Vision Basics
    - Tasks: Image Classification, Object Detection and Segmentation
    - Computer vision with preset features and shallow learning
    - Preview of feature learning and CNNs
- Deep Learning Frameworks
    - Why do we need deep learning frameworks?
    - Overview of the popular frameworks
    - Introduction to pytorch
